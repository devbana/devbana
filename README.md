# 👋 Hello there! I'm Akash S Devbanshi 

## 🧠 Limitless Wonderer | Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast  

Welcome to my GitHub profile – where ideas turn into models, and coffee fuels innovation ☕🚀

I’m an AI/ML professional with over seven years of experience designing and deploying advanced algorithms, from data collection and preprocessing to production-ready models. Skilled in TensorFlow and scikit-learn, I’ve built scalable predictive systems and optimized performance in real-world environments.

Recently, my focus has shifted to generative AI, where I develop precision pipelines, fine-tune models, and automate workflows to deliver high-quality outputs. I’m passionate about integrating AI seamlessly into existing systems to enhance functionality and create better user experiences.
